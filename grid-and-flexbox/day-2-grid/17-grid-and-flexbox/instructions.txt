17-grid-and-flexbox Instructions

We spent an entire day working with Flexbox as a hack -- making it function as a grid. 

We completed one exercise where we used Flexbox as we should, laying out an image gallery.

In this exercise, combine yesterday's Flexbox image gallery with the Grid layout of today's web page.

This is how layouts of the future will work!
